This directory contains patches and additional code for integrating
hfst-optimized lookup with NooJ. The version of NooJ this patchset targets is
v5.0.

Both weighted and unweighted transducers can be read, but as NooJ makes no
use of weights, they are discarded and have no effect on result ranking.
